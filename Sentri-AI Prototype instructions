Prototyping Instructions 

Step 0 — Prep Before You Start
Make sure you have:
n8n Cloud account (14-day trial) — sign up at https://www.n8n.io/cloud
Or self host


Your synthetic dataset CSV ready (attendance %, GPA, behavior score, etc.)


Airtable account with a base ready for the student data


Glide or Lovable account ready for dashboards


API keys for Airtable and other tools you plan to connect



Step 1 — Sign Up for n8n Cloud
Go to n8n Cloud


Click Start Free Trial (14 days)


Follow the signup process (email / GitHub login)


After signing up, you’ll see your workspace dashboard and the editor URL.



Step 2 — Secure Your Workspace
On n8n Cloud, your instance is already behind authentication.


Note your login credentials; you'll need them to access the editor.



Step 3  Add Credentials
Go to Settings → Credentials


Add new credentials for the tools you’ll use:


Airtable: API key, base ID


Google Sheets / Drive (if you want to upload CSVs there)


Webhooks / Glide / Lovable: optional for sending processed data


Credentials in n8n are securely stored and used in workflow nodes.

Step 4  Upload Synthetic Dataset
Go to your Airtable base and create a table for student data


Columns: student_id, name, attendance_percentage, gpa, behavior_score, warning_count, parent_engagement_level


Upload your CSV to Airtable manually, or use n8n Google Sheets node if CSV is hosted in Google Drive


This ensures your n8n workflow can pull real data.

Step 5 — Build the n8n Workflow
Here’s the recommended workflow for SentriAI MVP:
A) Trigger Node
Type: Manual Trigger (for testing) or Schedule Trigger (for automatic daily updates)


B) Pull Data Node
Type: Airtable Node → “Read” → select your base and table


This fetches all student records for analysis


C) Apply Prediction Logic
Type: Function Node or Code Node (for simulation)


Logic example:


return items.map(item => {
  const attendance = parseFloat(item.json.attendance_percentage);
  const gpa = parseFloat(item.json.gpa);
  const behavior = parseFloat(item.json.behavior_score);

  let risk = 'Low';
  if(attendance < 70 || gpa < 2.0 || behavior < 50) risk = 'High';
  else if(attendance < 85 || gpa < 3.0 || behavior < 70) risk = 'Moderate';

  item.json.ai_risk_level = risk;
  item.json.risk_explanation = `Attendance: ${attendance}, GPA: ${gpa}, Behavior: ${behavior}`;
  return item;
});

D) Send to Dashboard / Lovable
Use Webhook Node or HTTP Request Node to POST results to Lovable


Map ai_risk_level and risk_explanation for each student


E) Alerts / Notifications
Optional: Use Email Node or Slack Node to notify admin if any student is High risk



Step 6 — Test Workflow
Run manually first


Check the output in n8n → JSON response should have:


{
  "student_id": "S001",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "attendance_percentage": 60,
  "gpa": 2.5,
  "behavior_score": 65,
  "ai_risk_level": "High",
  "risk_explanation": "Attendance: 60, GPA: 2.5, Behavior: 65"
}

Verify that Lovable / Glide receives the data correctly



Step 7 — Activate Workflow
Click Activate → this makes the workflow live


If you used Schedule Trigger, it will now run daily/weekly automatically



Step 8 — Dashboard / Admin View
In Lovable / Glide:


Connect to the webhook or Airtable table


Display ai_risk_level with color coding (Low = green, Moderate = yellow, High = red)


Show risk_explanation as tooltip or detailed view


Now your admin can see which students need attention and why

Step 9 — Optional Enhancements
Add filters by risk level


Generate CSV reports automatically


Add parent engagement reminders


Track trends over time using charts in Glide / Lovable
